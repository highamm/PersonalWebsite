# Biography

I am an Assistant Professor at St. Lawrence University. I have worked on incorporating imperfect detection into ecological population prediction models with [Dr. Lisa Madsen](https://stat.oregonstate.edu/content/madsen-lisa)
 and [Dr. Jay Ver Hoef](https://sites.google.com/site/jayverhoef). Broadly, I am interested in statistical methodology applied in ecological settings.
