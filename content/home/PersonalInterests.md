In my free time, I enjoy hiking and jogging and have participated in the Corvallis half-marathon the past few years. I also like to play tennis and have coached the boys' high school tennis team at Crescent Valley High School since 2016. 

One data set that I like to play with from time to time is my own fitness data, which I have from November 2016 to now. I often feel like I am a bit more idle on the weekends (Saturdays and Sundays) in general, but, when graphing my fitness data from the last couple of years, there actually really isn't much of a difference in average distance walked between weekdays and weekends! (As an aside, you can easily spot the two Corvallis half-marathon days as outliers on the Sunday boxplot and the Friday boxplot outlier is from a hike to Broken Top Mountain in Bend which may be my all-time favorite hike).
